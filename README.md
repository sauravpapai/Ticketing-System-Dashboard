# Ticketing-System-Dashboard
Project Overview
This project focuses on creating an interactive dashboard for an IT support ticketing system using Power BI. The goal of the dashboard is to track and analyze the performance and efficiency of the IT support team by monitoring open, closed, and aging tickets. The project visualizes key metrics such as proactive measures, QA/QC processes, and monthly trends to help optimize support operations.

Features
Overall Open Tickets by Support Team: Visualize the open support tickets assigned to different IT support teams (Helpdesk, Network Operations, etc.) using a donut chart.
Open Tickets by Urgency: Display the number of open tickets grouped by urgency levels (Critical, High, Medium, Low) in a donut chart.
Proactive Support Tickets by Support Team: Show the distribution of proactive support tickets (e.g., system checks, software patching) by team.
Monthly Trend of Closed Tickets: A line chart tracking the trend of resolved support tickets over time, helping to understand workload and efficiency.
Proactive and QA/QC Ticket Trends: Display monthly trends for proactive support and QA/QC ticket closures.
Assigned vs Closed Tickets: Bar chart comparing the number of assigned tickets versus closed tickets on a monthly basis.
Open Tickets Aging: Track aging tickets to identify overdue support tickets requiring urgent attention.
Slicers for Filtering: Filter the dashboard by department (Support Team) and ticket status (Open, In Progress, Resolved, Escalated).
Tools Used
Power BI: Used for data visualization and creating an interactive dashboard.
DAX (Data Analysis Expressions): Used to calculate key metrics and add custom logic for complex filtering and aggregation.
